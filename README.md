# Tourist Attraction Finder

## Purpose:
This web app helps tourists find attractions based on their current location or a selected area.
## Tech Stack:
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Vue.js, Postman.
## Team:
Solo
## Description:
I wanted to create something that uses geolocation, the Google Maps API and GIS data  to display attractions, paths, and any additional details.
The user searches for a particular city or location, and using a dropdown menu, they specify what attractions they want to see from a list.
The project will expand gradually, as I continue to add more features as I learn more.

## Fun Fact:
This project allowed me to get hands-on experience with displaying and interacting with map data.
## Still To Do:
Work on the CSS (styling) with possible use of Bootstrap to refine the look of the app.
I would also like to add reviews.
